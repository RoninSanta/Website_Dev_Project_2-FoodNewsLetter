# Website Development Project 2-FoodNewsLetter
A food news letter website I created that promotes healthy eating, with simple recipes that are easy to prepare and high in nutrients. The website is dynamic website and will change its fonts and layout to accommodate small screen resolution devices such as smartphones as well as monitors.
- The website contains 5 pages, the `Home` Page, `Menu` Page, `Nutrition` Page, `About ` Page and lastly a `Report` where I stated all my development process and the purpose of my project.
