                        <p>We are a community based culinary club who have a passion for cooking and healthy eating. During these times of pandemic, it is easy to get carried away and stuff yourself with junk food or takeaways. These food might be delicious but they are a ticking sugar bomb in disguise. Therefore at "Cook Well,Eat Right" we focuses on re-inventing Asian dishes that are adored by millions around the world – by making them healthier, customizable and providing more transparency on their nutritional values.</p>

                         <h5><span class="highlight">Fat Loss</span> Made Simple</h5>
                         <p>The biggest mistake we have seen with dieters is that they go into a diet with the intention of being overly strict on what they allow themselves to eat. Not enjoying what you eat and settling for boiled Chicken Breast everyday instead of what you actually like. Well <span class="highlight">WE SAY NO MORE!</span> here at Cook Well,Eat Right we provide daily Asian Cuisines that are delicious, simple and fuel to maintain a healthy diet. We take Community Feedback seriously and constantly tweaks and update our menu to fit individual's dietary restrictions and preferences.</p>
